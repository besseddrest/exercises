 Find a 1st non-repeated char in the string for e.g. if string is "Salesforce is the best company to work for‚Äù returns 'l'

input: string
output: char

assuming we're not passing in punctuation
assuming we don't care about spaces
assuming we care about casing
keep a hashtable with quantities?

'1st non-repeated character':
- quantity of 1
- first char in our data structure with a qty of 1

iterate through string
tally each letter
skip spaces

is this O(n)?
